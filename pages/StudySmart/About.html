        Some Notes:
        There's still a lot of updates to add to the application and bugs I have to work out.<br>
        For example, multiple selection doesn't work currently for the dropdowns, and I have a few more features I plan to add. <br>
        However, it's gonna be a while before I implement that so use this in the meantime. <br> Happy studying!

    <h4>
        Why does this look like a shady website from the early 2000's?
    </h4>
    <p>
        I don't know how to CSS. I swear this isn't a scam though. The actual website is cleaner.

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <p>I used Natural Language Processing to analyze previously released AP Chemistry questions and trained a model to classify questions into their respective units based on some questions that were already classified from other sources and myself. The following application allows you to access this information. You can also help me fine tune the model by providing feedback for incorrectly classified questions.</p>
